 * sem_t - Semaphore type
 *
 * A semaphore is a way to control access to a common resource by multiple
 * threads. Such resource has an internal count, meaning that it can only be
 * shared a certain number of times. When a thread successfully takes the
 * resource, the count is decreased. When the resource is not available,
 * following threads are blocked until the resource becomes available again.
